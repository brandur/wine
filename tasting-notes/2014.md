# Tasting Notes 2014

## Churchill Douro Red (2014-07-06)

### Vitals

* **Grape:** 40% Touriga Nacional, 30% Touriga Franca, 30% Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo)
* **Region:** Portugal
* **Winery:** Churchill's

### Winery

Portuguese produce that began (and still largely is) a Port house. Made a name for themselves with fortified dessert wines before moving into dry wines.

## Wine

30% aged for 12 months in new and old French oak casks, and the remaining part kept in stainless steel vats. Aromas of candied black plums, marzipan, and molten rock. Palate of spice, pepper, blackberry, fig, and dried herbs. Racy acidity and a long, zesty finish.

### Vitals

* **Grape:** Cabernet Sauvignon
* **Region:** California (Sonoma)
* **Winery:** Clos Du Bois

### Winery

A French style winery in Sonoma operating for 35+ years.

### Wine

Exhibits flavors of blackberries, cassis, plum, mocha and coffee, roasted oak, cedar and cigar box. Fruity.

### Notes

Fruity with medium body (I think). Nice taste, but none of the flavors advertised above were particularly noticeable.
