# Tasting Notes 2014

## 2013 Tabordet "Le Champs des Vignes" Pouilly Fume

### Vitals

* **Grape:** Sauvignon Blanc
* **Region:** France (Pouilly Fume)
* **Winery:** Domain Tabordet
* **Year:** 2013

### Winery

Near village of Verdigny, is run by brothers Yvon and Pascal Tabordet.

### Official notes

Wine growing in Pouillly Fume dates back to the fifth century when the Romans dominated the area. In 1937, it became an official Appellation d'Origine Controlee (AOC) of France. Wine called Pouilly Fume is required to be 100% Sauvignon Blanc. Fume wines are known particulary for their smoky, flinty aromas (thus the "fume") that come from the high concentration of silex (flint) found in the soil.

The 2013 has aromas of fresh citrus zest, cool herbs, and wet flint. The mid palate brings some of those citrus notes from the aromatic. Juicy acidity on the finish.

## Official notes

30% aged for 12 months in new and old French oak casks, and the remaining part kept in stainless steel vats. Aromas of candied black plums, marzipan, and molten rock. Palate of spice, pepper, blackberry, fig, and dried herbs. Racy acidity and a long, zesty finish.
