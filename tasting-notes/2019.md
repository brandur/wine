### Vitals

* **Grape:** Merlot
* **Price:** $9.99
* **Region:** Bordeaux (FRance)
* **Winery:** Chateau Clinet
* **Year:** 2015

### Winery

Chateaux Clinet is one of the better Chateaux in Pomerol.
This is the result of a second label being launched by
Ronan Laborde, CEO of Clinet.

### Official notes

Smooth and easy drinking. Made from 100% Merlot grapes, it
lacks the aggressive tannin so often seen in young
Bordeaux, and is open and accessible right off the bat.

### Tasting notes

Has a nice acidity. Somewhat of an olive-like (?) aftertaste.
